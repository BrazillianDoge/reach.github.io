        <p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-6969</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Object Class: Frosty</b> 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Special Conatinment Procedures:</b> SCP-6969 is to be contained within a country named 'Canada'. Recently, it has breached it's containment and now resides in Cambodia. Efforts to re-contain it have all failed, so it's new temporary residence is Cambodia. It must be noted that SCP-6969's favorite location to reside is SISC(otherwise known as 'Southbridge International School Cambodia'), so if you are ever lost attempting to find it, wait at this school as it frequently visits SISC. It also must be noted that aggravating it may result in immediate death, dismemberment, decapitation etc.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> SCP-6969 is a humanoid figure that has an uncanny smile at all times. While it is aggravated, it's physical features are periodically distorted. Things that will cause this entity to become aggravated include saying that Canada sucks, insulting penguins in any way, being a stupid dumb idiotic idiot with 2 braincells that are competing for 3rd place, being cringe etc. In addition, if someone says something 'extremely cringe', SCP-6969 will say "GET OUT!!!!!" and said person will be launched into orbit, never to be seen again. This ability was used on SCP-682, but it would not say anything cringe thus not initiating the ability. It is theorized that the 'GET OUT!!!!!' ability can kill absolutely anything.</p>
